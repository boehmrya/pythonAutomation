      <p>The u (undo) command undoes the most recent thing you've done in vi. If you've deleted something by accident, the u command will restore it to your file. Whenever you delete something from a file, vi keeps a copy in a temporary file called the general buffer. You can also delete or copy lines into temporary files called named buffers that will let you reuse those lines during your current vi work session. This feature is particularly useful if you are editing a file that contains a lot of boilerplate text or repetitive code. When you quit vi, all the buffers are emptied; they are temporary storage that only lasts for your current vi work session.
